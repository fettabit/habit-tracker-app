# User Experience Flow

### Onboarding

1. welcome screen with app value proposition
2. quick tutorial on creating first habit
3. optional account creation (or continue as guest)
4. guided setup of 1-3 starter habits

### Daily Usage Pattern

1. open app to see today’s habits dashboard
2. review pending habits for the day
3. mark habits as complete with single tap
4. view updated streaks and progress
5. optional: review weekly/monthly statistics

### Habit Management

1. access habit list from main navigation
2. add new habit with customization options
3. edit existing habits (frequency, name, etc.)
4. archive or delete habits no longer relevant
5. reorder habits by priority or custom order
